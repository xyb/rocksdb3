# this script. (There are generally several versions installed by default, but
# that's not guaranteed.) For Linux, in order to get "manylinux" compatibility
# right, we need to run Maturin in a special Docker container. We hardcode
# paths to specific interpreter versions, based on where things are installed
# in this container. Our GitHub config has no effect on the the container, so
# we could build all the wheels in one job, but we stick to one-wheel-per-job
# for consistency.
